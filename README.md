## Life as a Developer
It sucks. You get up early and sleep late. 
You drink too much coffee and obviously there is always a client or coach to piss you off. 
That was my life until i met Nick, i called him the english guy.  



so, i learned about tech talks.
I prefere javascript because i prefere front end.
I work my all life!


When I open a web page, I see the code behind it.

I find it magical.

I love magic.

Life is beautiful.


Life is magic

magic is just github

git is not git but use git

No I hate git! I am lost!

Welcome in the jungle...

There are many animals

Some are meaner than others

THEY BITE
